# Proton Apps Installer
This is just a quick script to download RPMs for the proton apps suite. As this currently focuses on RPM files, it only works for Fedora, etc.

The script will download the RPMs and install the provided application.
Otherwise, if the application is already installed, it will update to the latest version.

## Usage
```sh
./proton_updater.sh APP


```
